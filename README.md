# Sign Rcognition
<h2>Aplication overview</h2>

<h3>This aplication is based on hand gesture recognition, you can train your own hand gesture, to be precised 5 sign via Tensorflow and the CNN that i created. For hand tracking i'm using Mediapipe and OpenCV for camera. Each sign takes about 200 photos to train(see the data_example directory).</h3>

<h3>The meniu contains the gesutres from 1-5.</h3>

<h3>If you click on the checkbox of one of the gestures, it will redirect you to the next meniu where you will put the hand in front of the camera at about 20-30 cm depth from the camera and then try to register different position of the sign to have a better accuracy.</h3>

<h3>When all the checkboxes are registered you can choose to train the model and it wll takes about 2-3 minutes.</h3>
